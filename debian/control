Description: Qt Messaging Framework library
 The Qt Messaging Framework Library provides a set of APIs
 that support the most common operations related
 to arbitrary messages such as creation, modification,
 retrieval, storage and display of messages. It
 defines interfaces which enable the integration
 of new message types. Therefore multiple applications
 can access the data independ of their storage and if
 necessary on a concurrent base.
